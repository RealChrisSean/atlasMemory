PARALLEL LIVES - MARKET RESEARCH & OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS
========================================================

THE CONCEPT
-----------
"Parallel Lives" - An AI that simulates how your life choices branch. You tell it about a decision you're facing, it creates branches showing different outcomes. Visual tree of life paths. Shareable.

Core mechanic: The branching/save point system already built in atlasMemory becomes the product itself, not just infrastructure.

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS SUMMARY
----------------------------

The space is WIDE OPEN.

- No well-executed version exists
- The one GitHub project with the exact name is abandoned (0 stars, broken demo)
- Games like BitLife prove massive appetite for "what if" life content
- But no clean, shareable, Nutlope-style tool exists
- Nobody has done the visual branching tree approach


WHY YOUR VERSION WINS
---------------------

1. Actually works and looks good
   - Real, functional product vs abandoned hackathon projects

2. Visual branching tree (killer feature)
   - Most tools show one timeline at a time
   - You show the actual tree with clickable branches
   - This is the differentiator

3. Shareable URLs
   - "Here's my life if I took that job vs stayed"
   - Social/viral potential
   - Compare life paths with friends

4. Clean UX
   - Paste your situation
   - Get branches
   - Explore visually
   - No account required to try

5. Open source with one-click deploy
   - Nutlope style
   - Developers can fork and customize
   - Deploy button (Vercel/Railway)
   - .env.example with just API key needed

6. Built on real tech
   - The atlasMemory branching system is the foundation
   - Not just a ChatGPT wrapper
   - Vector search for finding relevant context across branches


TECHNICAL FOUNDATION YOU ALREADY HAVE
-------------------------------------

From atlasMemory:
- Memory storage with vector embeddings
- Branch creation (save_point)
- Branch switching (load_point)
- Branch listing and deletion
- Hybrid search (vector + fulltext)
- Multi-user support (user_id isolation)

What needs to be added for Parallel Lives:
- AI generation layer (life path narratives)
- Visual tree UI component
- Shareable URL system
- Possibly SQLite + sqlite-vec for zero-friction local dev


MARKET VALIDATION
-----------------

BitLife's success proves:
- People love exploring "what if" life scenarios
- The concept is instantly understandable
- High engagement with branching life choices
- Shareability drives growth (people share wild life outcomes)

Gap in market:
- BitLife is entertainment (fictional character)
- Nothing exists for YOUR actual life decisions
- No tool for "I'm deciding between job A and job B, show me both futures"


NEXT STEPS
----------

Scope v1:
- Define MVP features
- Choose tech stack (keep TiDB or switch to SQLite for fork-ability?)
- Design the visual branching tree UI
- Plan the AI prompting strategy for life path generation
- Create shareable URL structure
- Build deploy button flow
